- [ ] proxy project that takes away Oauth2 complexity out of the small DevOps script (Consultants requirement)
- [ ] Introduce similar application in Python or GoLang, as DevOps usually prefers that over Node.
- [ ] move some code form appcontroller to specific controller
- [ ] Move infrastructure to private DB connection
